        Since my early childhood, I am interest in computers and all that has to do with it. In June 2022 I received my high school diploma from the department of Informatics at HTL St.PÃ¶lten.
        I am currently doing my mandatory service, also called &quot;Zivildienst&quot;. When I am not in front of the computer, I enjoy travelling around, visiting new places and taking pictures with my camera or phone. I also enjoy cycling. </div>
