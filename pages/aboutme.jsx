          Hello, I am Niklas Haiden, currently living near Vienna in the
          beautiful country of Austria. Since my early childhood, I am interest
          in computers and all that has to do with it. In June 2022 I received
          my high school diploma from the department of Informatics at HTL
          St.PÃ¶lten. I am currently doing my mandatory service, also called
          &quot;Zivildienst&quot;. When I am not in front of the computer, I
          enjoy travelling around, visiting new places and taking pictures with
          my camera or phone. I also enjoy cycling.{" "}
